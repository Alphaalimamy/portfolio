### Week One:  Introduction to Databases and their Importance:
### 1.1 What is a Database?

**Definition:** 
* A database is an organized collection of structured data that is designed to be easily accessed, managed, and updated.

**Importance:**
* Databases play a crucial role in various applications and industries, such as banking, healthcare, e-commerce, and more.
* They provide a structured and efficient way to store, retrieve, and manipulate data.

**1.2 Benefits of Using Databases:**
* Data Integrity: Databases enforce data consistency and integrity through constraints and rules.
* Data Sharing: Databases enable multiple users to access and manipulate data concurrently.
* Data Security: Databases provide mechanisms for access control and data protection.
* Data Persistence: Databases ensure long-term storage and availability of data.
* Data Scalability: Databases can handle large volumes of data and support growth.

**Overview of MySQL and its Features:**

2.1 Introduction to MySQL:
* MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) widely used for web applications and other data-driven software.
* MySQL is known for its performance, scalability, and ease of use.
* It supports various platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.


2.2 Key Features of MySQL:

* Data Security: MySQL offers robust security features, including user authentication, encryption, and access control.
* ACID Compliance: MySQL ensures transactional integrity by following ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties.
* Scalability: MySQL supports scalable architectures and techniques such as replication and sharding.
* High Performance: MySQL provides optimization techniques, indexing mechanisms, and query caching for efficient query execution.
* Data Types: MySQL supports a wide range of data types, including numeric, string, date/time, and more.
* Stored Procedures and Functions: MySQL allows the creation of stored procedures and functions to encapsulate logic and enhance performance.



**Installing and Setting up MySQL:**
3.1 Installing MySQL:

* Download the latest version of MySQL from the official website (https://www.mysql.com).
* Follow the installation wizard and choose the appropriate options for your operating system.
* Configure the installation settings, including the installation directory, port number, and authentication method.

3.2 Setting up MySQL:

* Start the MySQL server after installation.
* Configure the root user password for administrative access.
* Verify the installation by connecting to the MySQL server using the command-line interface or a GUI tool.


**Basic SQL Commands (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE):**

**4.1 Introduction to SQL:**

* Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standard language for interacting with relational databases.
* SQL allows users to perform operations such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data.


**4.2 SELECT Statement:**

* The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables.
* Syntax: 

```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
* Example: 

```sql
SELECT name, age FROM student WHERE age > 10;
``` 
**4.3 INSERT Statement:**

* The INSERT statement is used to insert new rows into a table.
* Syntax: 
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2)
```
**4.4 UPDATE Statement:**

* The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing data in a table.
* Syntax: 
```sql
 UPDATE table_name 
 SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 
 WHERE condition
```

**4.5 DELETE Statement:**

* The DELETE statement is used to remove rows from a table.
* Syntax:

```sql
  DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
### Sample Problems:

**Problem 1: Create a table called "Students" with the following columns:**


* student_id (integer, primary key)
* student_name (varchar(50))
* age (integer)
* email (varchar(100))

**Problem 2:**
Insert a new student into the "Students" table with the following details:

* student_id: 1
* student_name: Rugiatu Salieu Kamara
* age: 20
* email: rugiatu.salieu@example.com

**Problem 3:**
Update the age of the student with student_id = 1 to 21 in the "Students" table.

**Problem 4:**
Delete the student with student_id = 1 from the "Students" table.
