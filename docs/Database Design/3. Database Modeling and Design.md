### Week Two: Conceptual, Logical, and Physical Database Design:

**2.1 Conceptual Design:**
* Conceptual design focuses on understanding the business requirements and creating a high-level representation of the database.

* The Entity-Relationship (ER) model is commonly used for conceptual design.
* The result of conceptual design is an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), which represents entities, attributes, relationships, and cardinalities.

**2.2 Logical Design:**

* Logical design translates the conceptual design into a more detailed representation using a data model like the relational model.
* The logical design includes defining tables, attributes, relationships, and constraints.
* The result of logical design is a logical schema, which can be implemented using any relational database management system (RDBMS).

**2.3 Physical Design:**

* Physical design involves specifying how the logical schema will be implemented in a specific RDBMS.
* It includes decisions about storage structures, indexing, partitioning, and other physical implementation details.
* The goal of physical design is to optimize performance, scalability, and storage efficiency.
* Entity-Relationship (ER) Modeling and Diagramming:

**2.3.2 Entity-Relationship (ER) Model:**

* The ER model is a popular data modeling technique for representing entities, attributes, relationships, and constraints.
* Entities represent real-world objects or concepts.
* Attributes describe properties or characteristics of entities.
* Relationships capture associations between entities.


**2.3.2 Components of ER Diagrams:**

* Entities: Represented by rectangles and labeled with entity names.
* Attributes: Represented by ovals and connected to their respective entities.
* Relationships: Represented by diamond shapes and labeled with relationship names.
* Cardinality: Describes the number of instances participating in a relationship (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many).

**2.3.3 Example ER Diagram:**



### Normalization: 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, and BCNF:
**2.4.1 Normalization:**
* Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to eliminate redundancy and dependency issues.
* It involves breaking down a table into multiple smaller tables and establishing relationships between them.

**2.3.2 Normal Forms:**
* First Normal Form (1NF): Ensures atomicity by removing repeating groups and making each cell hold a single value.
* Second Normal Form (2NF): Ensures that non-key attributes depend on the entire key, eliminating partial dependencies.
* Third Normal Form (3NF): Ensures that non-key attributes depend only on the key and not on other non-key attributes, eliminating transitive dependencies.
* Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF): Ensures that every determinant is a candidate key, eliminating non-trivial dependencies.



**2.4 Database Constraints and Keys:**
2.4.1 Constraints:

* Constraints define rules and restrictions on the data to maintain data integrity and consistency.
* Common constraints include primary key, foreign key, unique, not null, and check constraints.

2.4.2 Keys:

* Primary Key: A unique identifier for each row in a table. It ensures entity integrity and enforces uniqueness.
* Foreign Key: A column or set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key of another table, establishing a relationship.
* Unique Key: Ensures that the values in a column or a set of columns are unique, allowing null values.
* Composite Key: A key composed of multiple columns to uniquely identify a row.

**Sample Problems:**

Problem 1:
Consider the following table representing a student's course enrollment:



| enrollID | studentID   | courseID    |
-----------| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1        | 101         | 201         |
| 2        | 102         | 201         |
| 3        | 101         | 202         |
| 4        | 103         | 203         |

Identify the:
* primary key(s), 
* foreign key(s), and 
* candidate key(s) for this table.

**Problem 2:**
Normalize the following table to third normal form (3NF):


| orderID  | orderDate | customer    | amount |
|----------|-----------|-------------|--------|
|   1      | 2022-01-01|   Alpha     |  100   |
|   2      | 2022-02-05|   Alpha     |  200   |
|   3      | 2022-02-10|   Rugiatu   |  150   |



**Implementation:**

Problem 1:
* Primary Key: enrollID
* Foreign Keys: studentID (refers to studentID in the Students table), courseID (refers to courseID in the Courses table)
* Candidate Keys: (enrollID), (studentID, courseID)


Problem 2:
The given table is already in 1NF. We proceed with the normalization process:

* 2NF: Separate the table into two tables, one for orders and one for customers.
* 3NF: Move the customer attribute that depends on the customer (non-key attribute) to the customer table.

**Normalized Tables:**

**Orders table:**


| orderID  | orderDate | amount |
|----------|-----------|--------|
|   1      | 2022-01-01|  100   |
|   2      | 2022-02-05|  200   |
|   3      | 2022-02-10|  150   |


**Customers table:**

| customer    | customerID |
|-------------|-------------|
|   Alpha     |    101      |
|   Rugiatu   |    102      |



Note: The provided implementation assumes familiarity with SQL syntax and assumes that the database management system (e.g., MySQL) is already set up and running. Students should have access to a suitable database environment to execute the sample problems and queries.


**Assignment:**

1. Design an ER diagram for a university registration system that includes the following entities: 
* Student, 
* Course, 
* Department, and 
* Instructor. 
* Identify the relationships between these entities and specify the cardinalities.

2. Given the following table representing employee information:


| emp_id   | emp_name  | department  | salary    |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
|   1      | John Doe  |   IT        |  5000     |
|   2      | Jane Smith|   HR        |  6000     |
|   3      | Mike Brown|   IT        |  5500     |
|   4      | Lisa Green|   Finance   |  7000     |


* Normalize the table to third normal form (3NF).

3. Design a database schema for an online bookstore. The schema should include entities for Book, Author, Customer, Order, and Payment. Specify the attributes, primary keys, foreign keys, and relationships between these entities.


Note: Students are expected to create their own solutions for the assignment based on the concepts discussed in the lecture. The solutions can be submitted in the form of a diagram or a SQL script representing the database schema.
