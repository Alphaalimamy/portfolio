## Week One

## I. Introduction to Software Testing

### A. Definition:
Software testing is the process of evaluating a software system or its components to find if it satisfies the specified requirements and to identify defects or gaps between expected and actual results.

### B. Importance of Software Testing:
* Ensure software quality and reliability
* Identify defects and prevent their occurrence in production
* Enhance customer satisfaction and user experience
* Reduce development and maintenance costs
* Improve software performance and efficiency


## II. Different Testing Levels
### A. Unit Testing:
### Definition
* Testing individual components or units of code to verify their functionality.
* Focuses on testing small, isolated parts of the software.
* Tools/Frameworks: pytest, unittest.
* Practical Example in Python:


```python
# Example function to be tested
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

# Unit test using pytest
def test_add_numbers():
    assert add_numbers(2, 3) == 5
    assert add_numbers(-1, 1) == 0
    assert add_numbers(0, 0) == 0

test_add_numbers()
```

 ## B. Integration Testing:

### Definition:
* Testing the interaction between different software components/modules.

* Focuses on testing the interfaces and interactions between components.
* Tools/Frameworks: pytest, unittest.
* Practical Example in Python:


```python
# Example module to be tested
class Calculator:
    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b

    def subtract(self, a, b):
        return a - b

# Integration test using pytest
def test_calculator():
    calc = Calculator()
    assert calc.add(2, 3) == 5
    assert calc.subtract(5, 2) == 3

test_calculator()
```

## C. System Testing:

### Definition:
* Testing the complete and integrated software system.
* Focuses on testing the system as a whole against the specified requirements.
* Tools/Frameworks: pytest, unittest.
* Practical Example in Python:


```python
# Example system test using pytest
def test_application():
    # Simulate a user interaction
    # Test the complete system behavior
    # Check if the expected results are produced
    assert application.run() == expected_output

```

**D. Acceptance Testing:**

**Definition:**
* Testing the software from the user's perspective to determine if it meets the
user's requirements.
* Focuses on validating the software against user expectations.
* Tools/Frameworks: pytest, unittest, behave.
* Practical Example in Python:

# Example acceptance test using behave
Scenario: Add numbers 
*  Given I have entered 2 and 3 into the calculator
*  When I press the add button
*  Then the result should be 5 on the screen

## III. Introduction to Python and its Testing Frameworks
### A. Python Overview:

* Introduction to Python programming language and its features.
* Advantages of Python for software testing.
* Basics of Python syntax, variables, data types, and control flow.


B. Python Testing Frameworks:

* pytest:
  * Introduction to pytest and its features.
  * Writing test functions, test classes, and test fixtures.
  * Running tests, test discovery, and test organization.

* unittest:
  * Introduction to the unittest framework (built-in with Python).
  * Writing test cases, test suites, and test runners.
  * Assertions and test reporting.


## IV. Hands-on Exercise
In this week's hands-on exercise, we will focus on getting started with Python and its testing frameworks. You will:

* Install Python and set up the development environment.
* Write and execute basic Python scripts.
* Explore pytest and unittest frameworks by writing and running simple test cases.


V. Assignment

For the assignment this week, you will be given a set of requirements for a simple Python program. Your task is to design and write unit tests using pytest or unittest for the different functionalities of the program.

VI. Discussion Points

1. Why is software testing important in the software development life cycle?
2. What are the benefits of different testing levels (unit, integration, system, acceptance)?
3. How can Python and its testing frameworks help in automating the testing process?


By the end of this week's session, you should have a good understanding of software testing principles, the importance of testing, different testing levels, and an introduction to Python and its testing frameworks. The hands-on exercise and assignment will give you practical experience in writing and executing tests using Python.

Remember to ask questions, participate in discussions, and explore additional resources to enhance your learning experience.


```python
%pip install xelatex
```

    Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.
